Hello World.

Hi, this is a small library to convert lists of the form A, B, C to a string A, B, and C.


        /// Returns a list according to English grammar rules. Converts strings such as  A,B,C into A, B, and C. Also handles singular/plural prefixes/suffixes.  Quite fancy.

See the console demo for more example usage

Tests included.
